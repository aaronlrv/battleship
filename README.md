# Battleship

This project is a web-app version of the classic board game "Battleship"

## Highlight

This game was built using TDD (Test Driven Development) Implementing JEST Libraries. Using OOP Programming principles

## My personal Takeways
Approaching this using TDD, Writing tests and going back and forth without using my trusty ```console.log``` was a true learning experience. Learning how to write tests, configure tests and knowing what to test throughout the process was interesting. This project also helped me strenghten my OOP principles drastically
